# TODO

* Navigate Organizations

* Weekly scan for new versions

* "Add Organization" to scan for Pony repositories.

* Don't load non-corral repositories?

* Make sure that "owner" vs "organization" is correct in all places. Currently, probably still messed up.

* More search types?

* 'parent' and 'source' in GitHubRepository points to forked projects. Should probably present that
  in UI.
  
* 'excerpt' of the search hit to be extracted and sent to client. UI already done.

* Checkout project, build and publish documentation? Per version?
